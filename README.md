# UPlus - IN DEVELOPMENT

**Warning:** This tool is still in development, any usage of this tool is entirely your responsbility, I really do not recommend running anything in here until this disclaimer is removed.

UPlus will be a tool for stress testing games, servers or anything else that allows a client to connect via an application. This is accomplished by utilizing C Sharps memory management toolset, Sandboxie and some other hacky tricks.

This tool is based off my [previous tool](https://github.com/MiniHood/G-Plus) for stress testing [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod) servers.
